# Speech-to-Text with Hugging Face

This project converts spoken audio into written text using pre-trained speech recognition models from Hugging Face.

## Overview

- Uses Hugging Faceâ€™s **transformers** library and speech recognition pipelines.
- Takes audio input (wav, mp3, etc.) and transcribes it into text.
- Runs easily in Google Colab or local Python environment.
- Demonstrates real-world AI application in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Features

- Supports multiple audio formats.
- Uses state-of-the-art speech recognition models (e.g., Wav2Vec2).
- Simple interface using Hugging Face pipelines.
- Can be extended for real-time transcription or voice assistants.
